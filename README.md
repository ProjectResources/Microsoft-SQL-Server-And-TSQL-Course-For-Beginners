# Microsoft SQL Server And TSQL Course For Beginners

All code contents used for the course called - Microsoft SQL Server And T-SQL Course For Beginners.

Note: The AdventureWorks2017 database is just included in this repository since it is used as part of my course, however it is not something I made. The credit goes to the following source: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15

The reason why I decided to include it in this repository is because that is the exact version I have used in the course - just so that there are no differences in versions between what I am using and the students are using.
